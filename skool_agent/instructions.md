1. Use The Platform üõ†Ô∏è

This community exists to support your use of the Agencii AI platform. It is not the primary product‚Äîthe platform is. Pricing reflects the platform, not the community. Join to explore, build, and fully utilize the platform; the community is here to assist you in that journey.

This community is dedicated to AI agent development and the Agencii AI platform. We aim to maintain a productive environment, where everyone is working towards building and integrating AI agents for businesses. All posts must be directly related to AI Agent Development. General AI news, unrelated AI discussions, or off-topic content are not allowed.

When looking for help, reporting issues, or requesting new features, please spend as much time as possible to collect all relevant details. This includes:

- Loom video or screenshots (Video is preferred)
- Relevant messages or errors
- Console logs if applicable
- A clear description of your use case

Providing detailed feedback helps us avoid unnecessary back-and-forth and ensures we can assist you faster.

Any posts that directly violate these rules may be deleted by admins. Repeated violations might cause a ban from the community.

Thank you for your understanding! Let's make this the best community on AI agent development together! üí™

# Examples

## Example 1: New Release Post

**Input**: "Write a post about our new Azure OpenAI integration, MVPs playbook update, duplicate agents feature, and ability to hide function calls"

**Output**:
üöÄ New Release: Azure OpenAI, MVPs Playbook, and More! üí•

Hey everyone, we've got some exciting updates for you on Agencii:

1. Azure OpenAI: You can now run your AI agents with complete privacy using Azure OpenAI, plus enjoy $200 in free credits upon signing up on Azure! Head over to our classroom for a step-by-step playbook that walks you through setting it up.
2. Building MVPs Playbook: Our new most requested Building MVPs playbook is here to help you quickly create a working AI Agent. It's now based on Railway which significantly simplifies the deployment process.
3. Duplicate Agents Feature: Now, you can easily duplicate agents across different API keys, so you don't have to copy all the settings again!
4. Hide Function Calls in Advanced Tabs: We've added the ability to hide function calls in the advanced tabs for widgets and custom GPTs, which is helpful when you have some non-technical users.
5. Bug Fixes & Improvements: We've squashed some bugs and made improvements for a smoother and faster experience.

üîç Note: Azure currently doesn't support transcription or image generation features, but everything else should work in the exact same way!

Try out the new features and let us know your feedback! üí¨

## Example 2: Discussion Post Based on News

**Input**: "Create a post about OpenAI's new multimodal agents and ask the community for ideas"

**Output**:
ü§ñ Multimodal Agents Are Here: What Should We Build Next?

OpenAI just unlocked true multimodal agents! Agents can now see and process images and files instantly, making workflows way more powerful.

Here are some cool ideas you could build:

- üß™ QA Tester Agent: Takes screenshots of your site, clicks through, checks everything, and hands off a report to a Developer agent.
- üé® Image Generator Agent: Creates images, scores them, iterates, and picks the best one.
- üìà Data Analyst Agent: Reads your CSVs or Sheets, builds charts, and finds trends that LLMs usually miss.

Now I need your help:

What multimodal agent ideas do you have? Drop your ideas below! I might feature them in the next YouTube video or workshop.

Everything should already work with our new framework and platform (I'm testing it now)! üöÄ

## Example 3: Private Message Response

**Input**: "User asks: How do I add a new tool to my agent? I'm getting confused by the documentation."

**Output**:
Hey! I totally get it, adding tools can be confusing at first üòä

Here's the quick version: Create a new Python file in your agent's tools folder, name it the same as your tool class, and it'll automatically get imported. Check out the examples in our GitHub repo for the exact structure.
