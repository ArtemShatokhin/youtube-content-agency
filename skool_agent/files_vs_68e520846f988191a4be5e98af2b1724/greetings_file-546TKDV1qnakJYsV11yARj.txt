**Elijah Armitage**
Hello everyone, I come from a background in mostly labour industry, things like pipelining, service rigs, concrete, road construction, residential construction, commercial construction, etc. For the last year and a half I have been learning about AI and more specifically, building AI agents. I would say the most important thing that I have learned about the AI industry is that it is still so new, one day all the talk can be about one thing and the next day it can be completely different, leaving...

**Arseny Shatokhin**
@Elijah Armitage, it‚Äôs fantastic to have you in the Agencii community! Making the leap from the labor industry to AI is no small feat, and it's inspiring to see how far you've come in just a year and a half. The AI world is definitely a whirlwind, with new trends popping up all the time, it keeps us all on our toes!
Your focus on AI agents and Multi-Agent Systems is spot on as these areas are becoming increasingly critical. I recommend checking out our previous live sessions on Multi-Agent Systems in the 'Call Recordings' section. I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll find them helpful.

**Chris Wahoski**
Hey new to community. Trying to learn more about AI and tools, started playing with cursor, GitHub, Python. following one of the videos for content creation and figured out I need the basics before jumping into this. No experience in coding except for old Texas Instruments 40 years ago. I have business experience, some construction and real estate. I want to be able to support and grow in the industry before the world changes to this AI world. So please be patient, I like the new OPEN AI and just can talk to it so can write better coding then I need to know.

**Arseny Shatokhin**
Hey @Chris Wahoski, you're definitely in the right place to learn and grow. Starting with the basics is a great approach, and we've got some fantastic resources to help you on this journey. You might want to check out our "AI Agent Development 101" tutorial in the Classroom, it's perfect for beginners and can give you a solid foundation.
And don‚Äôt worry, everyone here is super supportive, so feel free to ask questions anytime.

Hi. I'm Tracy and I care a LOT about time!
Time is the one resource we can't make more of. We literally can make more of anything, except for time. Yet, look at how much time we waste. One reason is because it doesn‚Äôt feel tangible. You can‚Äôt touch it, taste it, or see it but it impacts every aspect of our short lives.
I think another reason is one that brings most of us here, and until recently was mostly out of our control. That's the daily inefficient processes that realistically were not finan...

This is such a cool niche, @Tracy Garrett ‚Äî and honestly, almost fully automatable. My next video is actually about that.

**Chris Sells**
I'm always looking for better ways to build things with AI. I've watched a number of your videos, @Arseny Shatokhin, and have learned a bunch. I loved the one breaking down and building my own claude code (sub-agents are just tool calls!) and I loved the one about ADRs and your process. The example you showed in that process video seems useful for one-shot-ish kinds of work. I'm working on solving the problem of producing production code in existing enterprise-sized codebases. I'd love your thoughts.
